A system's variety, as defined in system's theory or cybernetics, is the number of different possible states a given system can exhibit. A light switch has two, a large software system or an organization (a socio-technical system) has a virtually infinite number of states. Simply put, Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety states that "only variety can absorb variety". Or, as the author himself wrote in his 1958 "Introduction to Cybernetics", 

> "When the variety or complexity of the environment exceeds the capacity of a system (natural or artificial) the environment will dominate and ultimately destroy that system. In order to deal properly with the diversity of problems the world throws at you, you need to have a repertoire of responses which are (at least) as nuanced as the problems you face."

That is, you need a degree of flexibility and variety of means and tools to successfully cope with variety in the environment (or target system, for example the market) and to survive and thrive. Remember that old adage that says "when you only have a hammer, everything looks like a nail and needs thumping"? The more tools and actions you have available to use, the larger the variety of changes and challenges you will be able to deal with and compensate for.

Although Ross Ashby was talking about homeostasis and self-regulating biological systems, it was quickly understood that the same concept applied to other types of systems, including organizations. What's the minimum amount of flexibility to survive, adapt or thrive in a specific system or environment? History is strewn with the remains of systems that failed to adapt to changing conditions in their environments, from environmental ecology and evolutionary biology to modern organizations. The tragic episode of the Irish potato famine of the middle 19th century, for instance, was caused by an overspecialization on the potato as a staple crop, and when that crop failed (unforeseen changes in the environment) the system lacked the requisite variety to successfully respond to the changing condition. Our immune system has enough variety to cope with multiple disturbances but not enough to new diseases. A reduction in the variety of your immune systems makes your demise more likely. Same happens with organizations.

So, in order to survive and thrive in a complex environment, a system should be equally or more complex than the environment it is in. As per the Conant-Ashby good regulator theorem, "every Good Regulator of a system must be (or have) a model of that system", hence the importance of optimal mental models and the tools that can help you with that, and the perils of operating with an inadequate model, or one that is too simplistic, or based in limited heuristics. Of course, a perfect match is probably impossible in any complex environment on which multiple other systems and levers act and not all change can be foreseen.

## How is this relevant for organizations?

From the point of view of system's theory, there are basically two main ways of dealing with variety in the environment: (1) __to try and attenuate it__, reduce or limit somehow, (2) __absorb it__, or, to use the original terminology, regulate it, that is, exert some control over it that satisfies the needs of the regulator. 

Normally it is better to go for (2) although it is not easy, and that is why we often see attempts to control variety. In politics for example, democracy and "pluralism" are regulatory systems based on the principle of increasing regulatory variety in order to absorb the wider system's variety. On the other hand, all manners of totalitarian regimes are regulatory systems which attempt to attenuate, reduce or inhibit system variety in a specific direction. Therefore, there is a balance to be found, ideally, between incorporating a diversity of skills, vision, creativity and background and maintaining a certain cohesive sense identity and shared sociocultural foundation to stay vital and oriented towards positive outcomes as a group (this is valid for teams, organizations or societies). The reason that (2) is preferrable is that variety can rarely be really reduced even when applying very drastic means. See Stafford Beer's book "Designing Freedom" for an exploration of this topic. 

In the context of organizations, it will not be possible to tightly couple the organization to the target system (aka "the market"). The more tightly a regulator (a system) is coupled to the target environment, the best, which is why certain industries to be very close to the government. This is why we see additional different means by which large organizations try to attenuate environmental variety: patents, IP lawsuits, barriers to entry, regulatory capture, FUD, monopoly, cartels, lobbying etc). These are simply additional means in order to control an environment in which there might be other controllers try to regulate (control) it as well. At least in a relatively "free" environment. These are mechanisms to attenuate that are totally different in nature and approach to those that try to acknowledge variety by changing the organization to be nimbler, more decentralized, agile and more open to change.

Failure to satisfy this law manifests in one-size-fits-all solutions (microservices for every project), short-term goals or the frequently seen approach of trying and pasting strategies from past experiences in different organizations to the current organization's particular crux. Most likely will not fit well, as the nature of the systems and their contexts are bound to be too different. But it's a powerful human tendency (and bias) to try and apply known solutions to different problems as a way to reduce cognitive load. The strong bias to apply what worked (or we like to think it worked, selective memory bias) to new situations. So we reach out for that old hammer one more time. Even doing what you've always done does not guarantee getting the same results if the surrounding systems or environments change, which they do. Or if you are heedlessly applying the same recipe to a different system.

Teams and organizations that live in complex environments with high variance, are generally going to face unknown unknowns, unknown variables and unanticipated changes, therefore, in order to absorb variety, they must develop systems that have the **"necessary slack and flexibility to allow them to respond to external stimuli by absorbing new information and developing new strategies and services to counter them"**. Quoting Robert Dilts, 

> the satisfaction of the Law of Requisite Variety is the defining condition of a successful enterprise or team, and is the limiting condition of 'downsizing'. An effective organization or team must have the 'requisite variety' to be able to perform all of the functions and handle the diversity of conditions which are necessary to achieve their desired outcomes. If a company 'downsizes' below the threshold of regulatory variety required to adequately perform its tasks within the dynamic system surrounding it, it is in serious danger of going the way of the Neanderthal.

It can be then said there is a continuum or axis from one extreme of flexibility to another of standardization. All organizations will have a tendency to standardize, that is to control and reduce variety. Organizations that prioritize efficiency will try to standardize processes to regulate inherent variety, hence bureaucracy and rigid processes that take months to complete, risking going too far. Moving along the axis towards standardization reduces variety and works better in slower and more controlled environments with limited variety. Conversely, it does not works so well when variety is unknown or in the case of more complex environments with accelerating variables across multiple dimensions such as customer behavior, market conditions, and technology in general. This is why companies need to constantly explore optimization of operations and process to get better outcomes or even to stay the same in the face of changing conditions. Becoming digital is all about this, ultimately.

This law also implies that we need to acknowledge and embrace complexity and diversity in implementing organizational change to ensure that it is sustainable and effective, and not fool ourselves with unmerited simplifications of reality cut down to fit 2x2 matrices and other tricks to make reality more palatable at the cost of leaving too much detail out. It is comforting, I realize, to try and keep things simple, as that makes us feel like we are more in control, that we understand and we are more comfortable making decisions along a simple logic. Incidentally, something similar happens in politics, every time we are sold simple solutions and easy pre-cooked slogans to face complex problems. As the inventor of Wardley Mapping, Simon Wardley, says **"the act of taking something complicated (like a machine) and breaking it down into small but manageable components or using a mechanism to sense uncertain change in a complex environment is not the same as trying to manage such a system by pretending it’s a 2x2 matrix. As Einstein would say “Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler”"**

## So, what do we need to look for?
Easier said than done, but some ideas to absorb variety are:

- Adaptability in the face of varied challenges, probably accelerating as well. This is another pressing factor that pushes us to reuse from a small repertoire of solutions in trying to cope with constant change and challenge
- Embrace some form of agility to accelerate an iterative cycle of evaluation (see OODA Loop)
- As a leader, cultivate a range of strategies and perspectives that you can apply to decision-making so as to navigate complex situations as  effectively as possible
- Diversify solutions and strategies in thought and approach, widen the space you search for solutions, hopefully injecting some innovation.
- Promote diversity. Now, this does not mean diversity as stupidly understood today based on irrelevant identity attributes, but in the sense of teams with experience in diverse backgrounds, markets, disciplines and perspectives. This can normally be articulated through cross-functional teams breaking across traditional silos, Skunkworks teams and so on
- Continuous Learning and skill building, and getting ideas as well from outside your narrow domain.
- Decentralize decision-making. Crowdsource devising solutions to other team members  that might be normally not involved and tapped for insight.
- More flexible and nimbler organizational structures to respond to change faster.
- Look to maintaining the ability to adapt to rapid technological changes or risk becoming obsolete - and displaced - quickly.
- Improve information flow (correct information, that is) for example accurate and timely data to enable (near) real-time decision-making.



Conversely, avoid 

- One-size-fits-all (apparent) solutions 
- the (in)famous "we've always done it like this here"
- Rigidity to reverse a decision or course of action because of emotional investment or the need to "save face" 
- Inflexible and slow protocols and processes
- Rigid planning and budgeting
- Silos and little empires
- Oversimplification (naïve)
- Unwarranted complexity for its own sake (large organization with ossified structures are prone to add complexity that doesn't actually contribute to matching environmental variety, that is, inefficiencies that pander to legacy managerial structures).

That being said, easier said than done and not a sufficient guarantee.

As with everything else in life, there is a balance to strike and a constant iterative process of improvement

- It is difficult to adequately measure a system's or an organization's complexity and build matching response capabilities.
- Balance complexity and simplicity. While Ashby's Law calls for matching environmental complexity, organizations still need to maintain a manageable degree of simplicity and efficiency in their operations and processes. Finding the right balance is challenging.
- Constantly hone your ability to adapt to environments that exhibit fast change.
- All of the above is probably going to place constraints on the resources available to you.
- There will be inertia and resistance to change to be dealt with.
- Maintain focus and work to counter change fatigue, there has to be a purpose and a sense of pace vs just perceived chaos, along with transparent communication

The law does not have to be understood as a call to endlessly maximize variety in order to cope with the environment. Or that having some enough variety is sufficient to guarantee control.

There is a unfortunate reality at the bottom of it all, which is that any system or regulator will necessarily have a limited set of tools to control a limited number of selected variables in the larger environment in which it finds itself. There are limits to how far a target can be controlled by a regulator, to use the proper system's theory names, and there will exist other levers affecting the environment but that are of your control. 

## A Closing note
Ultimately, the real world is a mess of systems with varying degrees of coupling between them. This clearly manifests itself in the challenges of the modern Western societies that are showing cracks when facing an increasing amount of diversity across multiple dimensions, cultural, ethnical, technological, societal, sexual and so on in no particular order, or even what topics fall within the Overton window. The tensions around the push towards having to forcibly assimilate that increasing variety evidences there are no easy ways to manage that or to adopt strategies and tools that make that easy and manageable and produces a reaction in the opposite direction towards reducing variety (without going into discussing here what seems to be better).

Why did I write this? it seemed a very interesting topic, and I have a penchant for this sort of theoretical disquisitions.

By the way, if you are wondering what Cybernetics have to do with this topic, bear in mind that this word comes from Ancient Greek κυβερνήτης (kubernḗtēs, “steersman”), from κυβερνάω (kubernáō, “I steer, drive, guide, act as a pilot”) (whence English govern). The term was used already in 1948 in the book Cybernetics by Norbert Wiener, and hence, the theory or science of controlled systems, processes and communications either in organisms or machines. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cybernetics 

They say "dead languages" but those are the root of many of the concepts we use today unknowingly.
