Everyone has heard about VUCA, many have heard about BANI too, but had you heard of RUPT and TUNA? Yes, I know, seeing all of these together can look and sound ridiculous. However, let's get to know them.

# VUCA
VUCA, coined by the U.S. Army War College in the 1980s (its military origins are also one if its apparent criticisms by people who nevertheless rely daily on technology with similar military origins, but I digress), describes the world we live as __Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous__. As a system of thought, revolves around an idea expressed by Andrew Porteous: "Failure in itself may not be a catastrophe. Still, failure to learn from failure is." This perspective underlines the significance of resilience and adaptability in leadership. 

This framework focuses on:

- the increasingly rapid changes happening without (apparently) predictable patterns (hence the volatility)
- how the future becomes increasingly difficult to forecast (uncertainty)
- how multiple interconnected factors influence situations (complexity)
- how cause-and-effect relationships become unclear (ambiguity) due to the accrued complexity.

In the business context, VUCA helps organizations understand why traditional management approaches may fall short in today's environment. VUCA can manifest everywhere, from supply chains to uncertainty in consumer behaviors, increasing complexity in compliance with multiple global regulations, and ambiguity in market signals all simultaneously. There are variations of VUCA, such as VUCA+, VUCAD (D for Digital), D-VUCAD (for Disruption and Diversity).

# BANI
BANI, developed by futurist Jamais Cascio in an article in 2020, putting forward the idea that our world has now become __Brittle, Anxious, Nonlinear, and Incomprehensible__. I am not so sure about total incomprehensibility but it's easy to see how the feeling of not be able to understand and have a measure of control will lead to anxiety. This framework argues that our systems are increasingly fragile, and that does not mean only ecological systems, also the technical systems that undergird our civilization. And that these systems can shatter rather than merely fluctuate (brittleness, representing, as the author states, illusory strength, The old myth of the colossus with feet of clay applies here). This creates in us a constant stress and fear about the (lack of control over the) future which then pervades society (creating anxiety) and produces outcomes that are disproportionate to inputs (nonlinearity and the result of amplification dynamics in complex systems), and that certain situations certainly pose a challenge to our ability to analyze or fully understand them and their ramifications (incomprehensibility).

The COVID-19 pandemic exemplified BANI characteristics: brittle healthcare systems, widespread anxiety (helped and induced, though), nonlinear infection patterns, and an initially incomprehensible virus behavior (a problem compounded by misinformation, some of it willfully).

# RUPT
RUPT, a newer framework created by [The Center for Creative Leadership](https://www.ccl.org/), describes our world as __Rapid, Unpredictable, Paradoxical, and Tangled__. This perspective emphasizes the following characteristics of our world understanding it as defined by 

the unprecedented speed of change (rapid) across multiple domains - domains and global systems are now inextricably interrelated if they are to work at all, thus increasing complexity
the inability to rely on past experiences to predict future outcomes (unpredictable)
the coexistence of simultaneous but seemingly contradictory truths (paradoxical, and also contributing to incomprehensibility if I may add)
the intricate interconnections between various systems and problems (tangled).

 Consider how technological advancement can be said to exhibit these traits: accelerating innovation cycles, unpredictable adoption patterns, paradoxical effects on human relations, and tangled relationships with and repercussions on society, economy, and politics. 

# TUNA
TUNA characterizes our environment as __Turbulent, Uncertain, Novel, and Ambiguous__. This model is part of the Oxford Scenario Planning Approach (OSPA) developed in "[Strategic Reframing](https://www.amazon.com/Strategic-Reframing-Scenario-Planning-Approach/dp/0198820666)". This model (like all of them, basically) shares some overlap with VUCA but specifically emphasizes turbulence, constant disruption and instability across domains - not only in business environments - constantly impacting organizational strategies, which I think contributes to reduced comprehensibility and anxiety novelty, unprecedented situations requiring new solutions an highlighting the need for organizations to develop creative problem-solving capabilities and adaptability in decision-making processes in order to respond quickly to turbulent changing conditions. Uncertainty in predicting future outcomes and Ambiguity are already described by preceding frameworks.

 Organizations operating in a TUNA environment must look to develop capabilities to navigate persistent disruption while maintaining strategic direction, deal with multiple uncertainties and acknowledge the existence of multiple unknowns simultaneously, create innovative responses to novel challenges, and make decisions despite unclear information, for which the development of data-driven decision making is key. 

The rise of artificial intelligence can be an example of a TUNA scenario: turbulent market dynamics (at least to a certain degree), uncertain future implications, novel technological capabilities, and ambiguous societal impacts. This is because this broad technology and market is quickly developing in multiple phases of the Genesis, Custom Built and Product stages of the [Wardley Maps](https://www.wardleymaps.com/) evolution model. 

# What to do about them?
This is the part that feels like pontificating. Entire books are written - and careers built - on these topics, but here go some ideas

- __Embrace agility__. In VUCA etc. environments, your decision-making processes must be flexible and you need to empower teams not only to adapt quickly, also because most often they know the terrain, they're at the coalface and can have more data and know what to do. Be prepared to pivot quickly in response to short-term changes.
- __Resilience__. RUPT demands resilience and crisis management in our strategies. Leaders should focus on building organizational resilience through scenario planning, risk management, and cultivating a culture of adaptability. Build redundancies in critical systems, diversifying supply chains, and develop a culture that can withstand and recover from shocks. You should read or re-read "Antifragile" to understand how some systems benefit from shock, volatility, and disorder. How could your organization, or some parts of it, actually improve under stress?
- __Prioritize innovation and continuous learning__. Innovation, creative problem-solving, experimentation and a culture where failure is seen as a learning opportunity are key elements, just as keeping employees updated on emerging trends, technologies, and best practices.
- __Small experiments__. As a complement of the previous point, do small experiments instead of making large, or difficult to reverse decisions. This approach aligns well with the need for agility in RUPT and BANI environments, allowing for rapid learning and adaptation.
- __Digital Transformation__. focus on enhancing operational efficiency, improving customer experiences, and create new business models. This is particularly important in navigating rapid changes.
- __Data-driven decision-making. develop strong internal data analytics capabilities and teams to gain insights, predict trends, and make informed decisions.
- __Develop Multiple Scenarios__. Given the unpredictability in these environments, organizations should engage in scenario planning. This involves developing multiple potential future scenarios and preparing flexible strategies for each. This will also help you be more robust when it comes to risk management and corresponding strategies or contingency plans.
- __Optionality__. the importance of maintaining options to adapt to unforeseen circumstances. In VUCA and TUNA environments, organizations should cultivate multiple strategies and be prepared to pivot quickly.
- __Collaborative Ecosystems / Networks and Cross-functional teams__. 
- __Emotional Intelligence__. Leaders must be aware of the emotional aspects and overloads imposed by uncertainty and do their best to mitigate that. Good communication is key.
- __Simplify by Removal__. Also from the previously mentioned "Antifragile" book, the idea of via negativa, or improving systems by removing vulnerabilities than adding complexities. In VUCA and BANI environments, organizations should focus on eliminating fragilities and unnecessary complications. Have a look at your processes, do they really propel you or are more like an obstacle course?
