# Guide for the Corporate Survivalist
### Or how to avoid being replaced by AI any time soon

- __Design arbitrary, undocumented processes__ - Establish arbitrary & undocumented random processes and TOMs with unclear handoffs between uncoordinated teams (preferably involving at least three external vendors) and frequent stalls, these are not bugs but features

- __Redundancy isn’t waste—it's insurance!__ If you can build it in, so much the better. Think overlapping responsibilities, incompatible duplicate data silos and tools. Ever heard of Antifragility?

- __Manual intervention__, use ad lib, like the salt and pepper of corp life. Frequent escalations and "quick syncs" are your friends, especially if they are routed through you so you can delay and claim overload. If a task can’t be completed without an ad hoc escalation, you’re on the right track, because then you can also defer any resolution or decision and augment uncertainty

- __Vagueness is a defense__. Uncertainty, poor objectives and reporting, murky KPIs (the more the merrier), pre-alignment meeting meetings and weekly progress calls (for example that weekly alignment to sync up on the topics discussed on the other weekly sync)

- __Standardization is for the weak and the replaceable__. Resist standardizing anything for any mildy plausible reason, such as “Client-specific,” “highly regulated,” "custom/bespoke”, or the classic ”my case is special because” . Consider the power bestowed by custom data and file formats as well as proprietary old-school tools only two guys in your team understand. True survivors thrive on artificial complexity.

- __Hoard on to your data__ (for compliance and privacy reasons, of course). Silos are like walls and provide valuable defense (and budget).

- __Build your own moat__ with Shadow IT around your silo. Remember this formula: Shadow IT + custom formats + Data Silos + in-house tools = impenetrable fortress.

- __Set up as many dependencies as possible__. The more blockers, cross-stream dependencies, and change committees you create, the more irreplaceable you become. And if nothing gets done—well, make sure that’s someone else’s KPI.

- __Rules about meetings__. send the invites with no agenda, content or even a descriptive title (placeholder for project alignment, agenda TBD is a good default), never deliver on the TBD, miss a few people and no follow-ups please

- __Sacred Legacy__. keep those legacy systems going on for a few more years making integration more difficult, maybe become the sole expert for that old server no one dares touch because no one knows what critical process runs there. Instill fear of risk and cost, so that any CIO will leave this for the next guy

- __Stay in pilot phase indefinitely__. Ensure pilot and evaluation and assessment phases last as long as possible and in loops. Most problems can be solved “when we move to the next phase,” which is conveniently always “in planning.” Claim you are aligned with the ancient Chinese idea of [wei wu wei](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_wei), if cornered. You can always use ever changing goal posts and undefined business goals to discard MVPs and other threatening initiatives.

- __Invent and change roles on a whim__, but call it [Dynamic Role Allocation](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/the-key-role-of-dynamic-talent-allocation-in-shaping-the-future-of-work) to your advantage, so no one knows what they are supposed to be doing, even those pesky agents. You cannot automate much when you don't know what to do.

- __Codify Indecision__ in your standards and policies (if you are forced to have them at all). Make sure they are full of “generally,” “typically,” “as appropriate,” and "accordingly" thus ensuring any request can be sent back for clarifications, interpretations, or yet another working group / committee (remember the first point in this list)

- __Strategic silence__. If your position gives you this privilege, improve processes and escalation by deferring replies or not replying to important topics so that uncertainty and escalations are fostered. Perfect the way of the passive/aggressive. This also has the added advantage of clouding the fact you have no idea yourself either.

- __Heavy Artillery Support__. Involve Legal, HR or Procurement as early on and often as possible. nothing stops processes or automation in their tracks like the phrase “we’re waiting for legal.”

## Other possible tactics

- Do not digitize at the source whenever you can, and if you have to, make sure the files are lost, stored "somewhere" or corrupted. Losing backups can also help here.
- Ensure tickets have to be raised for ab·so·lu·te·ly everything, and with very relativistic SLA's
- Spreadsheets are to be painted, not connected to actual data sources or dashboards
- Reports on reports and ask for consensus in circles. Also, try to schedule around people's PTO for enhanced process clogging.
- If you are forced to document things, just store recordings of meetings and unclear documents in disparate SharePoint sites with very diverse access permissions for different people. Make them have to scavenge-hunt for every morsel of inaccurate data. But make sure to say it all complies with [FAIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data), of course.
- Master the art of dropping bits of inaccurate information / data / knowledge to different people / teams at inadequate times so that everyone has a partial - and wrong - picture and work on unaligned assumptions.
