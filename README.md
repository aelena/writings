# What is this about?
I decided to create a public repo to have a single place where I can collect my writings and posts on stuff that piques my interest, explorations of different topics, or stuff that I write as part of my learning journey.
I will be adding both new stuff as well as things from the archives.

## List
In no particular order

- [My notes on Werner Vogels' 2025 AWS:reInvent keynote](./notes-vogel-aws24.md)
- [On the project pre-mortem technique](./on-premortems.md)
- [Guidance for adopting FOSS](./foss.md)
- [Notes on the overreliance of organizations on consulting firms](./overreliance-consultancies.md)
- [Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety](./ashbys-law.md)
